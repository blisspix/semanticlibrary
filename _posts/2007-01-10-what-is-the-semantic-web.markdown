Before we can work out what the Semantic Library might be all about, we need to look at the Semantic Web.

The Semantic Web (or at least, [the idea of it](http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2000/11/01/semanticweb/index.html)) has been around for several years now. The Semantic Web is about [data and meaning](http://www.w3schools.com/semweb/default.asp). This is great for librarians because much of this is achieved with metadata. Scientific publishing, which libraries are also increasingly involved with through Repositories and Open Access [also stands to benefit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web).

Like Web 2.0, which consists of a range of attitudes and applications, some new some old, the Semantic Web is a collection of standards, metadata, and technologies - eg Dublin Core, OWL and RDF.
