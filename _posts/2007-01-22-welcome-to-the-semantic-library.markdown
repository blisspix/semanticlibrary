Welcome to Semantic Library - here we'll be discussing what impact the Semantic Web will have on libraries, and whether it will lead to 'library 3.0'

Later on, we hope to publish some how-to's and technology summaries, and put together an online learning program for librarians who are interested in learning more.

Why consider the Semantic Library now when we have only just come to terms with the social/'2.0' library? It's important to keep an eye on the horizon to ensure that what we're doing now helps us to prepare for what's coming next.

First up, we'll look at some of the definitions of the Semantic Web and what expertise librarians bring.
