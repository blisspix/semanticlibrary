Libraries are moving quickly beyond banning of phones and embracing the potential of mobile technologies. Some do this by providing a [more welcoming physical space ](http://tametheweb.com/2007/11/national_university_of_singapo_1.html)for phones, and others are developing SMS reference andÂ mobile-friendly sites. As ownership of mobile-enabled devices increases not only in developed nations but in the developing world, the mobile web has enormous potential to be a lightweight, flexible architecture solution to bridging the digital divide.

I've put together a page of resources on the [mobile web and uses for libraries](http://www.semanticlibrary.net/mobiles-and-the-semantic-library/). Please feel free to contribute links to projects and mobile resources for this page in the comments or on [our wiki](http://semanticlibrary.pbwiki.com/).
