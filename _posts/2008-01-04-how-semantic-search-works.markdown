[ReadWrite Web](http://www.readwriteweb.com/) has a recent article on how semantic search works, [Semantic Search: Myth and Reality](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/semantic_search_the_myth_and_reality.php). The article points out that semantic search will not solve all our search problems, it's simply impossible. For those working with datasets, there will always be a great deal of cross-tabulation, manipulation (to reformat and present data) and manual work to be done to bring together answers to queries. Yes, semantic search might help save time in the initial stages of a query by giving more meaning to the terms we use to query with, but search is still, at its heart, a human construct and will always be open to interpretation and error. The article makes the important point that -


> These are computationally challenging problems that really have nothing to do with understanding semantics. The misconception has been perpetuated since early days of the Semantic Web that somehow, because we will annotate the web, we will be able to solve these super complex problems. This is simply not true. There are fundamental limits to what we can compute, and a class of problems that have an exponential number of possible solutions is not going to be magically solved because we represent data as RDF.


Right now we search based on word occurance (ignoring for the moment Google's fancy rankings, inbound link rankings, and other fancy search criteria and patterns in high-end databases). In the future we will search using semantics for words+concepts+inferred trust. We will probably never be able to search purely by opinion or emotion. And that's fine - because we can make that judgement for ourselves. We're human after all.
