Depending on where you live or which experts you listen to, we're either nearing the end of Winter/Summer or already in Autumn/Spring. Whichever way, the year is still young, as is this blog, so here's a wrapup of discussion about the semantic web, RDF, metadata and libraries from around the biblioblogosphere in 2008 to give you a sense of where we've been and where we're headed -

> Which leads me to wondering - is now the time for all good library hackers to come to grips with the state of the SemWeb art? Have we crossed some tipping point?

> RDF is certainly among the acronyms most identified with Semantic Web, but it’s not necessarily as complex as all that, and there are things we can do today to answer the question. Among the best of them (and one that will always deliver value), is to make sure our sites are marked up meaningfully. I know this sounds simple, but it’s surprising how few data-rich library sites take advantage of it.


[Would the Real “Dublin Core” Please Stand Up?](http://dltj.org/article/what-is-dublin-core/) Disruptive Library Technology Jester, February 19 2008


> So what is “Dublin Core”? Is it the abstract model? Is the set of terms that can be used as predicates in RDF expressions? Is it the legacy 15-element XML-based standard for describing digital objects? Count me in among those want more in trying to figure this out….

Commenting on the [Talis podcast](http://talis-podcasts.s3.amazonaws.com/twt20080207_TimBL.html) with Tim Berners-Lee, Rick Mason notes,


> Libraries are still playing catch-up in the social data area. We are starting to implement tagging and book recommendations, but we are not all that far along with implementing things. What this quote reminds me is that we should also be keeping an eye towards making it easy to export data out of our systems.


Which bibliobloggers seem to be most interested in the semantic web? There should be no surprise that at this stage  cataloguers, systems librarians and those working closely with data are talking about it more than those working the reference desk. Semantic Web development is still in the realm of schemas and RDF, FRBR/RDA rather than end-user 'stuff' that we can promote to library users.

But if you are a mostly reference-sometimes techie person (like me!) the time to be involved is now so that we can have a hand in developing what ever the stuff for users is going to be. Now is when we need to start identifying needs and problems that might be solved by the Semantic Web, rather than waiting for tools to be developed which we try to fit to needs and problems.
