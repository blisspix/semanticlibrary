[Karen Coyle](http://www.kcoyle.net/) [answers the four FRBR questions](http://www.frbr.org/2008/03/07/four-frbr-questions-karen-coyle) and says,


> The use of FRBR has the potential to allow us to move library data into the nascent semantic web. We could even be visible pioneers in that area, given the huge amount of carefully crafted data that we have in our databases. The semantic web functionality promises a much richer information environment than our library catalogs provide today, and one in which library data can interact seamlessly with the entire Web.


Wouldn't it be nice to be a pioneer? [Check out the FRBR blog](http://www.frbr.org/2008/03/07/four-frbr-questions-karen-coyle) for more of Karen's answers and previous participants.
