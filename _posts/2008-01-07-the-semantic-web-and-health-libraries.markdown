The UBC Health Library has [added a page on the Semantic Web](http://hlwiki.slais.ubc.ca/index.php?title=Semantic_web) to their [wiki](http://hlwiki.slais.ubc.ca/). Check it out for a links to resources on the concept and a great section on why health librarians should care -


> The semantic web could potentially be a place where much of the knowledge of librarians and computer scientists could be built into the web itself. What's remarkable about semantic technologies is that they will not affect the look or feel of our 'web experiences', and may perform tasks without our end-users' knowledge.


An exciting prediction!
