It's hard to tell where conference season begins and ends these days. Just about every week there's a conference somewhere that may be of interest to those working on the mobile or semantic web. While as yet there aren't many exclusively-semantic events, there will be parts of the programme of other events that will cover related topics. Here's a few upcoming events:

[WSDM 2008](http://www.wsdm2008.org/): First ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining, February 11-12, Stanford USA (today!)

[CHI 2008](http://www.chi2008.org/): 26th ACM Computer-Human Interaction conferene, April 5-10, Florence Italy

[FOSDEM2008](http://fosdem.org/2008/): Free and Open Source developers European Meeting, February 23-24, Brussels Belgium. (I am considering attending this event)

[Mobile World Congress](http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/): February 11-14, Barcelona, Spain. Receiving enormous media coverage so be sure to watch out forÂ news about developing for the mobile web.
