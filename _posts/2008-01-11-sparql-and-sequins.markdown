The W3C recently took the wraps off a new query language for the Semantic Web, [SPARQL](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/). According to Computer World, this should [give the Semantic Web a big push forward](http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&taxonomyId=11&articleId=9057520&intsrc=hm_topic). According to the article,


> SPARQL is designed to be used at the scale of the Web to support queries over distributed data sources independent of format. It also can be used for mashing up Web 2.0 data.


Semantic Web applications are starting to surface as well, with the creation of [Twine](http://www.twine.com/) (in invite-only beta - if you have one let me know) and [DBpedia](http://dbpedia.org/About). The emergence of end-user apps, and not just languages and specifications is a clear sign that the pace of development is beginning to accelerate.
