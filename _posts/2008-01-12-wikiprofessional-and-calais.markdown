### WikiProfessional


Via the [RIN blog](http://www.rin.ac.uk/node/377), Jan Velterop recently of Springer is heading to KnewCo, which is behind [WikiProfessional](http://www.wikiprofessional.org/portal/). WikiProfessional is designed for researchers and scientists to interact using a database and wiki with a Semantic Web foundation -


> The core functionality of          this workspace is a newly invented "Semantic-Wiki".         The Semantic-Wiki connects the new relational MediaWiki software (Wiki editing          capability in a relational database structure) to the computational text analysis          technology, called the Knowletâ„¢


They're starting out with a large dataset from Medline, which is a great idea to avoid the problem of having no examples to work in new websites.

To get started, you create a desktop, where you can view Knowlet and Expertise workspaces. This is really getting to the trust aspect of the Semantic Web. One thing that is slightly disconcerting is being confronted with another self in the expertise space - my name is a fairly common one, and the system tries to find me in Medline.

If I was one of the authors listed, I could select articles and identify them with me. Other traditional databases have tried to do this, such as CSA's Scholar's Universe. Now if WikiProfessional makes this type of thing portable and linkable to other IDs, such as OpenID, then I think it would have a lot of value.

No doubt there will be many more features added to WikiProfessional as it makes the move out of Alpha, so it's worth keeping an eye on.


### Calais


From Reuters, [Calais ](http://www.opencalais.com/)is all about making data richer by semantically tagging it.  There's a bit of questioning as to [what's in it for Reuters](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/reuters_calais.php), but I can imagine that for journalists it would make sorting and identifying important news stories and other content easier.

If you want to try it for yourself and skip the API signup check out [Calais Text Tagger](http://autotagger.opensynapse.net/). Feed it some text and it will give you tagged RDF in return. I fed it the last post on the blog, and got back:

Continent: Africa
IndustryTerm: so many services, web projects, social web, energy
Company: CNN, Google
Person: Ethan Zuckerman
Technology: mobile phones, PDF, SMS
