Over on the [wiki](http://semanticlibrary.pbwiki.com/), we've started putting together a very basic outline of what an online course to learn about the Semantic Web and Libraries might look like. My aim is to provide something for the middle-ground of early adopters - those who are enthusiastic about these new technologies and are keen to learn more, but who might not have gotten around to sitting down with a book on RDF yet. I hope it will be a gentle introduction, not overly code-heavy, and with plenty of examples and discussion of practical applications in libraries and research.

Watch us try to build a course from the ground up or get involved and have your say about what your want to learn, or what you might teach!

More details available on the [learning program page](http://semanticlibrary.pbwiki.com/Learning-Program) on the [Semantic Library wiki](http://semanticlibrary.pbwiki.com/Learning-Program).
