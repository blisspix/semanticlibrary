[Dean Guistini](http://weblogs.elearning.ubc.ca/googlescholar/archives/045478.html) at [UBC Academic Search](http://weblogs.elearning.ubc.ca/googlescholar/) explains why libraries have a role in the Semantic Web:


> Without over-simplifying, this is what the [semantic web](http://hlwiki.slais.ubc.ca/index.php?title=Semantic_web) is about - making connections between documents, their ideas (and intellectual content) and the people we serve in libraries. If the web is going to be the platform for ideas and lifelong learning well into the 21st century - perhaps something else will replace it? - then librarians need to take a good look at the emerging [semantic web](http://hlwiki.slais.ubc.ca/index.php?title=Semantic_web).


Take a look at the whole post - it's a great argument about the expertise libraries bring to the Semantic Web. An article co-authored by Giustini and [Allan Cho](http://www.allanslibrary.blogspot.com/) on web 3.0/Semantic Web is due very soon.
