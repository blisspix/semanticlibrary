The [BBC Internet Blog](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/) has a post about the [accessibility of their new homepage](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2008/03/homepage_accessibilty.html), and the challenges in designing it. One of the things they did was use Semantic Web markup -


> Using the results of our user-testing we made [semantic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) mark-up of the page a priority, ensuring that each panel of the homepage design could be treated and navigated consistently. For example, the H3 heading always applies to the title of the content panel whether the content is in a table, a list or paragraph, and a logical structure of headings follow underneath.


A great example of a practical use for the Semantic Web. Presumably, with the consistency on the homepage that also lends the site to multichannel and transform content to different devices more easily.
