[Read/Write Web](http://www.readwriteweb.com/) has a great post on the Semantic Web which gives a brief primer on theory, technology, and applications. ["Semantic Web Patterns: A Guide to Semantic Technologies"](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/semantic_web_patterns.php) is a great introduction to what it's all about with plenty of links to explore. The article also discusses the different meanings of the Semantic Web and how different technologies support different interests -


> The Semantic Web means many things to different people, because there are a lot of pieces to it. To some, the Semantic Web is the web of data, where information is represented in RDF and OWL. Some people replace RDF with Microformats. Others think that the Semantic Web is about web services, while for many it is about artificial intelligence - computer programs solving complex optimization problems that are out of our reach. And business people always redefine the problem in terms of end user value, saying that whatever it is, it needs to have simple and tangible applications for consumers and enterprises.


A must read, but do also read the [critique of this article](http://blogs.talis.com/nodalities/2008/03/nitpicking_alexs_semantic_web.php) over at Nodalities which debates some of Alex Iskold's claims. I find this comment about Semantic search particularly interesting,


> Success for the Semantic Web wouldn't be improving search, but marginalizing it.


Read and enjoy them both! What both of these articles make clear is that what the Semantic Web "is" is far from clear, and given how much hyperbole there is around what is "2.0" I wonder how far we are from that.
