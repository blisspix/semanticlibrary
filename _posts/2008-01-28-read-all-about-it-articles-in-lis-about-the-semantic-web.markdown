So who's writing about the semantic web in LIS, and what are they writing? I plan to take a look at that through a series of Reading Notes posts. I hope to try out the [Blogging on Peer Review Research](http://bpr3.org/) (BPR3) way of blogging about scholarly articles.

So what's out there to draw from?Â  Taking a look at articles in the open access repositories in LIS containing the keywords semantic web -

[19 articles in D-LIST
](http://dlist.sir.arizona.edu/perl/search/simple?_order=bytitle&abstract%2Fkeywords%2Ftitle_srchtype=ALL&_satisfyall=ALL&abstract%2Fkeywords%2Ftitle=semantic+web&_action_search=Search)[101 articles in E-LIS
](http://eprints.rclis.org/perl/search/simple?title%2Fabstract%2Fkeywords=semantic+web&full=&_order=bytitle&abstract%2Fkeywords%2Ftitle_srchtype=ALL&_satisfyall=ALL&_action_search=Submit)

The most interesting thing besides the large difference in the number of results? How many articles in E-LIS on the topic are not in English, but rather in European languages, reflecting that development of the Semantic Web has been quite strongly supported in Europe until now.

Stay tuned for Reading Notes, soon!
