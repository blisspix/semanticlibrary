[Ivan Herman](http://www.w3.org/People/Ivan/), [W3C Semantic Web Activity](http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/#activity) Lead, gave a presentation on the [State of the Semantic Web](http://www.w3.org/2008/Talks/0518-SanJose-IH/HTML/Overview.html)  at this week's [Semantic Web](http://www.semantic-conference.com/)  Technologies conference (via: Kingsley [Idehen's Blog Data Space](http://www.openlinksw.com/blog/~kidehen/?id=1365)). It's a great overview of what technologies we have now, what people are working on, how to get involved. But I was pleased to [see a slide describing those that are on board](http://www.w3.org/2008/Talks/0518-SanJose-IH/HTML/img6.html) with deploying the Semantic Web:


> Major communities pick the technology up: **digital libraries**


Further slides have a few examples of what libraries are doing and uses in academic research. Awesome.
