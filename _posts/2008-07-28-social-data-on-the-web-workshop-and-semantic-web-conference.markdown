Two very exciting events being held this October in Germany:


> The 1st Social Data on the Web workshop (SDoW2008) co-located with the 7th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC2008) aims to bring together researchers, developers and practitioners involved in semantically-enhancing social media websites, as well as academics researching more formal aspect of these interactions between the Semantic Web and Social Media.


Find out more at the sites for the [Social Data on the Web workshop](http://sdow2008.semanticweb.org/) (SDoW2008) - call for papers currently open, and the [7th International Semantic Web Conference](http://iswc2008.semanticweb.org/) (ISWC2008).

One of the suggested topics up for discussion is Semantically-Interlinked Online Communities (SIOC) which the Library of Congress is involved with, and there are several Talis staff involved with organising the program, so perhaps the library community will have a growing role in this conference. If I wasn't moving back to Australia next month you can bet I would be there!
