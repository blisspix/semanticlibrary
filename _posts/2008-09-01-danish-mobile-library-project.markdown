It's been a whirlwind couple of months, but one of the things I was happy to see at the [2008 IFLA Congress in Quebec City](http://librariesinteract.info/2008/08/18/2008-ifla-congress-in-quebec-city/) last month was a flyer for the [Mobile Library](http://www.mobib.nu/) service at the Aalborg Libraries in Denmark. The Mobile Library includes content specifically adapted for mobiles, as well as a mobile-friendly OPAC. Currently, the site is only available in Danish language but an English version is also being developed.

I was also hearing more discussions about mobile services while at the Congress, which is encouraging for future development.
