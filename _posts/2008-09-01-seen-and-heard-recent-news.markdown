A few bookmarks while I was conferencing and traveling:


#### [Semantic Library: RDF in Practice](http://gslis.simmons.edu/podcasts/index.php?id=77)


[This recent podcast](http://gslis.simmons.edu/podcasts/index.php?id=77) by Robert Wolfe at MIT (via [Catalogablog](http://catalogablog.blogspot.com/2008/08/semantic-web-podcast.html)) is what I'll be listening to on my commute tomorrow. Topics include SIMILE, RDF and SKOS.


#### [RDA satellite conference report](http://www.yorku.ca/yul/bibserv/blog/?p=172)


The Bib Blog has a good [summary of the RDA pre-conference](http://www.yorku.ca/yul/bibserv/blog/?p=172) held prior to the 2008 IFLA Congress last month. The linked presentations give a good introduction to RDA and the linkages to FRBR, FRBRoo and the Semantic Web.


#### [One Web, No Go](http://www.slideshare.net/oliverweidlich/wsg-august-2008-one-web-presentation/)


Oliver Weidlich's presentation, "[One Web, No Go](http://www.slideshare.net/oliverweidlich/wsg-august-2008-one-web-presentation/)" at the Australian Web Standards Group meeting in August (via [CaseyG](http://www.caseyg.com.au/post/47265557/slides-from-the-web-standard-group-meeting)) on the mobile web goes through the pros and cons of developing mobile-specific sites. A range of examples of (commercial) sites is also included. Libraries should be considering these issues now, as demand for mobile services grows and more OPACs are available with mobile options. For many, it will be more resource-efficient (and more logical in the long run) to focus on standards-compliant sites for any device rather than putting resources into a mobile-optimised site.
