David Bigwood points to the latest project from the [Public Knowledge Project](http://pkp.sfu.ca/) (who are behind the Open Conference/ Journal/ Monograph Systems software) - [Lemon8-XML](http://www.lemon8.org/) a web-based tool to convert word-processing documents to XML. [Bigwood notes](http://catalogablog.blogspot.com/2008/11/lemon8-xml.html),

This is an interesting development especially for repository developers, who are grappling with how to keep up with formats over time and recommendations about preferred deposit formats. Recent discussion in Australia has focused on [whether to prefer XML over PDF](http://groups.google.com/group/institutionalrepositoriescommunity-anz/browse_thread/thread/f79d090a9fd22c6d/74cdc78d4c6da3f3?lnk=gst&q=xml+pdf#74cdc78d4c6da3f3) (as a result of the recent [Brisbane Declaration](https://mx2.arl.org/Lists/SPARC-OAForum/Message/4606.html)), but one of the things that holds this back is a lack of tools to create XML effectively. Lemon8 is definitely a project to watch for those dealing with this issue.
