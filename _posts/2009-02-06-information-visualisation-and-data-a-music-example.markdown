Regular blogging will resume soon, but in the meantime, something completely different.

I'm a big fan of mashups and information visualisation. This link comes from the [Pitchforkmedia](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/) music blog. Promotion for this year's Grammy Awards focuses on some very [eye catching visualisations of some of the nominated artists](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/148444-thom-yorke-grammy-spokesman-extraordinaire), made up of the names of some of their favourite songs. An amazing mashup between structured data, tag clouds, and the style of ASCII art you might have made a decade or two ago. Click through to the article to view some examples of the ads (no CC/free versions available). The [LA Times](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2009/01/grammys-get-lil.html) has more about how they were created -



> "A Grammy spokeswoman says each artist was asked to give the Recording Academy 10-20 songs that influenced or affected their life and career. The lyrics and song titles are then featured in the print and television ads."



I attended a seminar today that asserted that data is not sexy, but I disagree. Data like this isn't just sexy, but it can even be beautiful. If you like work like this, [Information Aesthetics](http://infosthetics.com/) is one of my favourite blogs on the topic.
