The blog may have been quiet of late, but there has been a great deal happening out there. From linked data developments (especially at the Library of Congress) to some great new mobile tools, it's been a busy couple of months.

Regular blogging on these developments and others will resume in the next couple of weeks, as I've been otherwise occupied by a move to London. I will leave Australia (again, I moved back in August last year) next week. I'm thrilled that the timing means I will be able to attend [Mash Oop North](http://mashedlibrary.ning.com/)  in early July and will report back on that event here.

Amusingly enough, what has occupied quite a bit of my attention in the move is working out what to do for broadband and mobile service. I have been debating the pros and cons of buying an iPhone, or a netbook, European data roaming and mobile broadband. I have decided to be sensible and stick with my current hardware, but a lazyweb question if I may. Does anyone know of a good provider for mobile broadband roaming across Europe? Something like Vodafone Passport for broadband?
