A while ago now, [Jodi Schneider](http://twitter.com/jschneider) floated the idea of setting up a [Planet](http://www.planetplanet.org/) for Semantic Web and Libraries. I had some trouble with various flavours of the Planet and Venus software, so instead I put something I'm calling a ['Planet Lite' together in Yahoo Pipes](http://pipes.yahoo.com/fionabradley/semlibrariesplanet). Let me know if you like it! And feel free to suggest additional blogs, I have only listed a few to start.

[Semantic Web & Libraries 'Planet Lite'](http://pipes.yahoo.com/fionabradley/semlibrariesplanet): JSON and RSS also available.

Last week, I attended Mash Oop North, an one-day unconference about mashups in Huddersfield, UK. It was a great event, which I [wrote up in much more detail over at Libraries Interact](http://librariesinteract.info/2009/07/08/mash-oop-north-2009/). One of the best parts of the day was being able to spend some more time with Yahoo! Pipes, and the Planet Lite is the result after much tinkering and experimenting after I got home. Hooray for action-based outcomes!
