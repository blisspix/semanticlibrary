Once again, I find myself in a new year doing new things and being not entirely sure what to do with the blogs and domains I've dragged along with me.  

  

In 2009 I wrote several articles on next-generation catalogues thanks to my role in working on a new catalogue for the academic library I was working at. I then found myself not working in a library, but still writing about library catalogues. In 2010 I have one more article on the topic before I hang up my catalogue writing hat.  

  

The Semantic Web in libraries has started to take off in leaps and bounds, with all kinds of interesting projects taking shape. This blog will likely change shape and focus to align with new interests and developments in 2010.   

  

Happy new year, and here's to all kinds of interesting in 2010.
