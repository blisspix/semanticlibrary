A clear indication that concept of semantic web and libraries is moving into the mainstream - ALA's Library Technology Reports is publishing [Understanding the Semantic Web: Bibliographic Data and Metadata](http://www.alatechsource.org/library-technology-reports/understanding-the-semantic-web-bibliographic-data-and-metadata) by [Karen Coyle](http://kcoyle.blogspot.com/):


> The change that libraries will need to make in response must include the transformation of the libraryâ€™s public catalog from a stand-alone database of bibliographic records to a highly hyperlinked data set that can interact with information resources on the World Wide Web. The library data can then be integrated into the virtual working spaces of the users served by the library.


LTR is a great series, looking forward to seeing reviews of this title and a spike in interest in semantic web in 2010.
