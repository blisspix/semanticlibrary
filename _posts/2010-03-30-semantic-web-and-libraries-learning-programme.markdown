A recent email from a colleague reminded me of the p[roject that spurred the development of this blo](http://www.semanticlibrary.net/2008/01/18/learning-the-semantic-web/)g in the first place, the idea to create a free, grassroots online learning programme to help librarians learn about the semantic web. Somewhere along the way, as these things do, it fell down my list of priorities. And then that was two years ago. So, in case it is of interest to anyone, and since there were some great contributions by a number of people on the wiki and elsewhere, I've dropped the content we had back onto the wiki. Please feel free to use it, edit it, contribute what you want, and make something of it!
