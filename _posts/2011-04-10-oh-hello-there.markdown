It has been a very long time since I last posted here, and during that time I've done a great deal of thinking about what to do with the blog. I've had offers from colleagues to take it over and keep running it as a purely SemWeb blog, but I have been reluctant to let go of it (not sure why, since I haven't been posting). 

I recently went on a very interesting trip across the US trying to work out nothing less than The Future of our Profession. Much of what we discussed comes back to fundamentals: access and description. As we begin to think about how to write up all that we learned on the trip, I envisage that this blog will come back to life again, so don't unsubscribe just yet.
