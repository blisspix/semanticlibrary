[@nopiedra on a conference in Germany on semantic web in libraries.](https://mobile.twitter.com/#!/nopiedra/status/141991615597248512 )



I don't want to overly criticize this conference, as I don't have more information about it than this tweet. I am not the kind of woman to go around counting the number of women presenting at conferences. However, strategies to be inclusive of gender, new professionals and newbies (to new concepts) are a good thing in my book. Diversity is important, especially when it comes to emerging concepts and practices in the profession. I see this in my day job, working with library communities around the world to communicate better and to be more inclusive.

This blog has really fallen off the semantic web/linked data track, mostly because my interests have changed but also because keeping up was becoming a challenge. My strongest interest lies in working to communicate ideas, technology and practices in a way that is engaging to non-techies, and  new professionals. I enjoyed the pieces I wrote for FUMSI, Library Journal, and Internet Librarian International on these topics a couple of years ago, and of course this blog. 

Reader, perhaps this is just the kind of motivation I needed to get back into the topics that started this blog in the first place.
