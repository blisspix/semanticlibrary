Earlier today, [I asked on Twitter](https://twitter.com/fiona_bradley/status/167562052997611520) whether other librarians considered Project Management certifications (eg, PRINCE2) worthwile, or if knowledge of frameworks was sufficient.

I received a number of great responses from @sallyheroes, @janholmquist, @ahornby, @ellyob, @damyantipatel, @camcd, @aekins (thank you all!). In summary, some had been on training courses, but found certification quality to be variable. Others noted they wanted certification, but due to cost and other demands this hadn't been possible. And several shared that they thought experience and knowledge to be far more important overall.

Project Management is an great skill to have as an information professional, and can open up many opportunities. I have found working on projects with IT colleagues and consultants gave me the most exposure to PRINCE2 and Agile approaches, and the most experience in how projects really work, and where they can go off the rails. Get involved with systems migrations, web development, building new services as a project manager or team member.

My favourite book on the topic is Berkun's [Making Things Happen](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596517718?tag=scottberkunco-20&camp=14573&creative=327641&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=0596517718&adid=1B6JF6HWHDT0S5RYZNNM). An invaluable source when I started managing larger projects, and vastly more readable than the official PRINCE2 book.  


[Lean](http://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1328819291&sr=1-1) is another emerging approach, and which could be useful in reducing time to pilot and implement programmes and services. I'm keeping my eye out for forward-thinking libraries to start implementing it.
