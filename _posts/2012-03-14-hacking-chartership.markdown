Many library associations have professional development schemes, recognising ongoing learning, training and engagement with the broader profession. I've been a member of two of these schemes - [ALIA's Professional Development scheme](http://www.alia.org.au/education/pd/#PDScheme) and [Chartership in CILIP](http://www.cilip.org.uk/jobs-careers/qualifications/cilip-qualifications/chartership/pages/chartershipintro.aspx). Chartership is a peculiarly British concept, where most professions here are required to demonstrate ongoing compliance and development. It is a rather formal scheme, especially compared with Australia, and requires candidates to submit detailed portfolios and reflections on their work and activities.

CILIP has a pilot ePortfolio submission scheme (other options include [Mahara](https://mahara.org/)), but most are still submitting portfolios constructed from various word documents, CVs, event programmes etc. It is, to be honest, more daunting than I expected to collect all the documentation required. Joeanne has a great post on [collecting chartership evidence using Google Docs, Evernote and Twitter](http://www.joeyanne.co.uk/2012/03/14/collecting-chartership-evidence-using-a-google-form/). It's a real "of course!" post for me - the biggest stumbling block I've found in the chartership process is actually remembering to sit down and record activities attended and my reflections on them.

I now track all my projects and actions using [OmniFocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/) and write multi-chapter projects using [Scrivener](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php), which I expect to use in the latter stages of writing up my portfolio. [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/) holds much of my reading, which I will export to a list together with citations from [Zotero](http://www.zotero.org/) and [Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/).

It's a good reminder that sometimes you don't need elaborate tools - tools like Google Docs and Zotero which have been around for a long time can still be just as useful as anything else.
