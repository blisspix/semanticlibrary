Another week brings the world's second largest multi-sport event here to London. On Wednesday night, the Opening Ceremony of the Paralympics showcased ideas, imagination, achievement, science and, depending on your interpretation of a segment about reading, libraries: 



> The stadium had transformed by this point into a kind of library: homage was paid to the acquisition of knowledge, with, perhaps, a discreet political critique in play. If Boyle's message was "hands off our NHS", so Sealey and Hemmings' seemed to be "hands off our libraries".

A must-see.

If you are outside the UK, you probably had little chance of actually watching the Games live on TV. Until now. [YouTube has signed up to broadcast 500 hours of coverage](http://mashable.com/2012/08/31/youtube-to-stream-london-summer-paralympics-live/).
