I've been reading some of the posts on [work-life balance](http://www.attemptingelegance.com/?p=1857) elsewhere with interest. I recently started a new job and moved countries, so my sense of balance is always changing. Being able to understand (and ideally work in) languages other than English is important in my job, and so at various periods I've spent time working on Spanish and French (and Japanese, and brushing up my Italian...) but I haven't been able to attend classes as my work has had me traveling around the world 100+ days a year for the past few years. Trying to fit in language learning on top of everything else is a challenge, and no different from trying to learn a programming language, technical skill or other types of professional development - it takes time and effort.

Now that I'm in the Netherlands, I'm focusing on Dutch for a while. I think I've finally accepted that I'm not a textbook learner (stack of shame at left) and a once a week class isn't realistic since I am still traveling. Instead, I'm embracing opportunities for immersion and randomness. I discovered [Memrise.com](http://www.memrise.com/) via the Guardian's Chinese menu challenge  - the concept of gamification of language learning (or at least rapid vocabulary building) is very appealing. [Michel Thomas Method](http://www.michelthomas.com/) tapes have been around for a long time, but are very good at shortcuts for sentence construction. Whenever I watch TV, I try to understand the commercials, and I read [children's books](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jip_and_Janneke). There's any number of discussion groups for help, [chat groups](http://www.livemocha.com/), and [grammar courses](http://dutchgrammar.com/) to keep going.

It's a very random, non-linear way to learn, but by fitting in some learning here and there I hope it works.
