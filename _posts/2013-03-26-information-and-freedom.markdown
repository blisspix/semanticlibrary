One of the biggest lies told in libraries is that there are no life and death decisions to be made. Maybe that's true for me, and you, and for most librarians you know. But some of our colleagues are not so fortunate. And while most librarians are fortunate enough to be able to conduct their jobs without risk of [arrest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoia_Horn), [censors](http://www.pio.ala.org/visibility/?p=4173), or being [dismissed](http://www.ifla.org/news/out-now-a-new-faife-spotlight-on-the-dismissal-of-the-national-librarian-of-serbia), that may not be the case for some of our users who come to use our resources - whether they are researching a legal case, human rights, or coming to post their story online.
