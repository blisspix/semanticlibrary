[Lean In](http://www.amazon.com/Lean-In-Women-Work-Will/dp/0385349947), Sheryl Sandberg's book on women in leadership, gave me pause: does our profession encourage leadership, even though it is a female dominated profession? Do we have the types of opportunities that attract high-flyers?

Sandberg's assertion that it is possible to move between different disciplines and organisational types is heartening. A common complain from those who want to switch sectors in libraries is that employers don't recognise transferable skills like project management, negotiation, and communication over very specific attributes which can be learned on the job. And yes, we need some coders, but even in IT few people remain programmers throughout their entire career. At some point, if you want to move up, managerial skills take priority.

She notes that she "prioritised potential for fast growth and the mission of the company above title". I found myself nodding in agreement. Often we see libraries as being somewhat stationary - but most libraries have a department that is growing rapidly - and it is these areas within the sector to seek out.
