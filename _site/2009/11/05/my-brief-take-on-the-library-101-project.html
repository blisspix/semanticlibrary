					<h2>My brief take on the Library 101 project</h2>
<p class="meta">05 Nov 2009</p>

<div id="post">
<p>I&#8217;m not going to comment on the <a href='http://www.libraryman.com/library101/'>video or the essays</a> (from some great people which are really worth reading, though I would most definitely remove the fake Obama piece -it takes away the strength of what the other essayists have to say) other than to applaud Michael and David&#8217;s enthusiasm, but I did want to add and expand upon one small point in the project.</p>

<p><a href='http://www.libraryman.com'>Michael Porter</a> makes a very interesting comment about the inclusion of Hulu, a US-only video streaming service in the list of 101 &#8220;really important things to know&#8221; on the blog, Rebbetzin Man in Japan &#8221;<a href='http://dancherubin.blogspot.com/2009/11/library-101-or-is-it.html'>Library 101 or is it?</a>&#8221; and one that I would have liked to see made more strongly in the project -</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I see Hulu as a demonstration of successful electronic content distribution. I clearly understand many of the reasons <em>why</em> this service isn&#8217;t offered though a library channel of some sort, but to me, it typifies how far from the mark we have becoming in providing some types of access to electronic content. It is a lengthy conversation that needs specific sources and documents to further the proof of concern that I have here specifically, but I hope this provides some explanation for why that particular resource was in the list.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From my pov it represents an entire front of threats that libraries are not prepared to address any time soon. And that causes me grave concern. It is more than just a fad that iTunes, Amazon, Hulu, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, let you access content electronically that you cannot access through your library. I realize this is a large issue for Public Libraries <em>at this point</em>, but that will change imo and we are dangerously lagging in the legal and technical expertise that is require to effective navigate in these waters.</p>

<p>I wholeheartedly agree that we need legal and technical skills not only to make such content available in libraries, as Michael says, but also the skill, will, and momentum to advocate successfully to challenge licensing and contractual agreements that currently prevent or curtail libraries from making electronic content available in the format and method to the public that is permitted by law and <a href='http://www.ifla.org/en/publications/statement-of-principles-on-copyright-exceptions-and-limitations-for-libraries-and-archi'>library exceptions</a>.</p>

<p>Librarians need the confidence to not buy electronic books that have restrictive lending and printing conditions, or databases with article download limits, or even systems that don&#8217;t allow for the straightforward import and export of data. We need to work together, all of us, not just directors and managers, to point out flaws in licenses and products and make the case for change.</p>

<p>This is the kind of skill that really should be a &#8220;Library 101&#8221;.</p>
