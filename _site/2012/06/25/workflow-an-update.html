					<h2>Workflow: An Update</h2>
<p class="meta">25 Jun 2012</p>

<div id="post">
<p>Back in December, I <a href='http://www.semanticlibrary.net/2011/12/11/systemslayers-research-and-writing-workflow/'>posted about my research and writing workflow</a>, anticipating the flood of papers, presentations and documents I would be writing this year as we evaluate and report on a series of projects.</p>

<p>Recently, I had been working on tidying up Zotero and Mendeley across my machines (a 4.5 year old MacBook and a 3 year old iMac) and it was slow going. The computers are mostly synced except for a few apps, like Zotero. A couple of months ago the hard drive in my iMac completely failed and couldn&#8217;t be recovered following its trip to the Genius Bar. TimeMachine runs from my MacBook only. So, voilá, I have the references in Zotero but no longer most of the files. Which in a way is good because it&#8217;s almost like a clean slate, deleting old interests.</p>

<p>Scrivener, while a great tool for fiction, isn&#8217;t working out so well for other types of writing for me. I am also finding fragments of ideas and notes everywhere in other apps from NotationalVelocity to Evernote, in emails and OmniFocus. Somewhere along the way, <a href='http://ifttt.com/'>IFTTT</a> was added to copy starred tweets to Instapaper, and my reading queue overflowed. Too many tools, too much fragmentation. So much to my surprise, it&#8217;s turned out that the tried and true method of Word + reference manager (Zotero now, Endnote when I was in school) really is the best workflow for me. Have you found your workflow has changed, or just pivoted around the same type of tools?</p>
