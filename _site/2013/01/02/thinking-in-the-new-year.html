					<h2>Thinking in the New Year</h2>
<p class="meta">02 Jan 2013</p>

<div id="post">
<p>Another year, and another round of resolutions. Last year, I traveled 150,000 km and was on the road more than 100 days. And the year before, and the year before that. In November, I moved to the Hague for a new job and am looking forward to having more time for all kinds of projects, and inevitably, started the year with a resolution to update this blog more often.</p>

<p>This year, I&#8217;m interested in exploring the future: what impact will <a href='http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/138474/fareed-zakaria/can-america-be-fixed'>demographic change</a> have on libraries 20, 50 years from now? What role will we play as stewards and <a href='http://literateowl.com/2013/01/01/mission-creep-libraries-and-3d-printers-what/'>curators</a> in a post-collection world? How can we continue to encourage cooperation and cohesion across our profession?</p>

<p>Over the past few years, I&#8217;ve worked with librarians in many countries on organisational change and sustainability, to demonstrate the difference libraries make in a changing world. I&#8217;ve had the fortune to sit in on some <a href='http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/libraries/article/55131-you-have-two-maybe-three-years.html'>great pub conversations</a>, <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/blisspix/sets/72157624958528896/'>travel</a> to many libraries (see above), and strategise about the future. Few of those reflections have made it to the blog, so this year I aim to change that. More soon.</p>
