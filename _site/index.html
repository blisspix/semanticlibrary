    <p>The post-CMS landscapeThis week, I installed Drupal, then module after module after module to get it content-ready for a new project. Drupal is excellent, but it is big. Over the years, CMSs have made it easy to create content, but they have increasingly hidden the technology behind them. CMSs were certainly not giving me much motivation to get up to date with HTML5, CSS3, or jQuery.Development Seed is an organisation whose work I&#8217;ve admired for years - their open data and government projects are exceptional. In the midst of all the module installing I caught up on their transition away from Drupal, to static HTML. What? Static HTML? In 2013?It actually makes a lot of sense. Complex systems have a lot of potential failure points. They require scale. I work with people in developing countries who are on slow connections. Site speed and efficiency matters. For years I&#8217;ve hosted my...</p>

    <p>So Madonna was downgraded from VIP treatment in Malawi.  The first time I went to Cameroon I was very surprised to get the VIP treatment, and was incredibly humbled by the effort my colleagues must have gone to in organizing it. It was a surprising end to an intriguing few days that had begun in surreal fashion with watching myself on the prime time evening news talking about libraries. We set off on a 4 hour drive to the airport with the Director of Protocol, along the Yaounde/Douala trunk road which I heard is thankfully being upgraded. To the VIP lounge where my passport (and departure fee) were taken away and stamped. I spent the evening in the lounge talking to a senior member of the Finance Ministry traveling to an African Union summit, who was interested in hearing about libraries but suggested I still had time to have 7 kids. He...</p>

	<h4><a href="/2013/01/23/ik-leer-i-learn.html">Ik leer / I learn</a></h4>
    <p>I&#8217;ve been reading some of the posts on work-life balance elsewhere with interest. I recently started a new job and moved countries, so my sense of balance is always changing. Being able to understand (and ideally work in) languages other than English is important in my job, and so at various periods I&#8217;ve spent time working on Spanish and French (and Japanese, and brushing up my Italian&#8230;) but I haven&#8217;t been able to attend classes as my work has had me traveling around the world 100+ days a year for the past few years. Trying to fit in language learning on top of everything else is a challenge, and no different from trying to learn a programming language, technical skill or other types of professional development - it takes time and effort. Now that I&#8217;m in the Netherlands, I&#8217;m focusing on Dutch for a while. I think I&#8217;ve finally accepted...</p>

	<h4><a href="/libraries/2013/01/10/a-cut-too-far.html">A cut too far?</a></h4>
    <p>Libraries are taking on all sorts of new services - makerspaces, crafts, services for the unemployed, small business meeting zones, expanded training, gaming, you name it - some library somewhere has probably done it. But I can&#8217;t quite understand how we got to the point of butchery. Literally. A library in the US organised a session on Butchery and Books, featuring a live demonstration. I&#8217;m not sure what the books part consisted of. Am I old-fashioned in thinking that this is way-off mission? Or that I could never imagine such an event in the multicultural cities in which I&#8217;ve lived, or that it couldn&#8217;t possibly be hygienic (what happened to the meat afterwards?) Or wonder if their local community centre or night school doesn&#8217;t already serve this purpose? On 3D printing (the other craze seemingly sweeping libraries at the moment) David Lankes makes a point in the comments with which I wholeheartedly...</p>
