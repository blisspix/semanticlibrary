					<h2>A cut too far?</h2>
<p class="meta">10 Jan 2013</p>

<div id="post">
<p>Libraries are taking on all sorts of new services - makerspaces, crafts, services for the unemployed, small business meeting zones, expanded training, gaming, you name it - some library somewhere has probably done it.</p>

<p>But I can&#8217;t quite understand how we got to the point of butchery. Literally. A library in the US organised a <a href='http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324677204578187901423347828.html'>session on Butchery and Books</a>, featuring a live demonstration. I&#8217;m not sure what the books part consisted of. Am I old-fashioned in thinking that this is way-off mission? Or that I could never imagine such an event in the multicultural cities in which I&#8217;ve lived, or that it couldn&#8217;t possibly be hygienic (what happened to the meat afterwards?) Or wonder if their local community centre or night school doesn&#8217;t already serve this purpose?</p>

<p>On 3D printing (the other craze seemingly sweeping libraries at the moment) <a href='http://quartz.syr.edu/blog/?p=2538'>David Lankes makes a point</a> in the comments with which I wholeheartedly agree: &#8220;The common mission for me across librarians is to improve society through facilitating knowledge creation within their communities.&#8221; It&#8217;s important to be able to experiment. There&#8217;s an argument for a library somewhere trying out something new, and maybe it will serve their community, or maybe it will fail and we can hear all about in a #failfaire. But we also need to focus on what only we can do, and do it well. Every library does that in their own way, even if it isn&#8217;t quite headline catching enough for the Wall Street Journal.</p>
