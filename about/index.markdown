This blog explores technology, changing work and social practices, development and (sometimes) the semantic web and intersections with libraries. Semantic Library is written by [Fiona Bradley](http://www.fionabradley.com), an Australian librarian currently working for an international organisation in the Netherlands, writing in a personal capacity. My comments and views are my own and not necessarily those of my employers.Â Feel free to [email me](mailto:fiona@semanticlibrary.net).

Topics since 2008 include:



	
  * Semantic web: True write once, publish many: hamstrung until now by proprietary software, proliferation of XML schemas, and a lack of end-user tools.

	
  * Metadata: Meaning and context within and between objects, new languages.

	
  * Rich open data: Geotagging, eScience data for everyone

	
  * Content anywhere, especially mobile

	
  * Make your own software: bringing software and tool creation to the masses

	
  * Two opposing ends: on demand anywhere (video, TV, radio, text), lightweight flexible architecture


Political and governance issues;


	
    * Ubiquitous Open Access

	
    * Access to Knowledge (A2K) in the developing world
